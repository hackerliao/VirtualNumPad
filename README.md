So yeah

this thing will be very unprofessional

basically i was trying to learn blender and i found out that theres a bunch of shortcut using the numpad

so i decided to code this thing so it stick on top of my screen and provide a numpad for me

You can also use many other keyboard shortcuts on it too

In this thingy

You can switch the background of your VNP

You can toggle the visibilty of your VNP(with only on and off becuz im lazy)

You can change dark and light themes

You can add your own translation!!!

Also feel free to contact me if you want to devote your own translation into this project


Special thanks to Deepseek!!


Reminder: there will be a folder called 'languages' if you directly use the jar file or the exe file, and translations go into there

(If you want to edit my code and publish yourserlf just mention my name somewhere in your interface or smth to make me proud of myself)
